RC Shield for the CAN node.
This board was designed for a Spektrum RC receiver (such as the AR6100e) to plug directly into it to interface with the PIC on the CAN node. While there are only 4 hardware Input Capture peripherals onboard the PIC, that can be done in software as well, so that all 6 channels can be used.

Additionally a jumper header is available to allow for binding transmitters.

Also the reason that all traces use vias to switch sides is so that this board can be manufactored on a board router.

The only parts necessary for this are:
 * 2x 2x7 .1" male headers
 * 1x 3x7 .1" female header OR 7x 1x3 .1" headers 
 * 1x 1x2 .1" male header (and 2-pin jumper)
