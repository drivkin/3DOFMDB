This shield provides an RS232 interface as a shield. It uses 5V to power a MAX3235E chip to do TTL/RS232-level conversion.

This shield expects pin B8 to be a UART RX pin (input to the PIC) and pin B9 to be a UART TX pin (output from the PIC).

BOM:
1 SMD1206   capacitor       .1uF
1 SOIC20    MAX3235E
